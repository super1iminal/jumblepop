# how to compile:
g++ [-o {name (without extension) of output file}] Entity.cpp Main.cpp ...
## notes:
- you need all of the .cpp files written in the compilation line, none of the .h files
- [means optional]
- {was a way for me to tell you that it has to be one word (no spaces)}
- you must be in the directory of the files you want to run (change directories by doing "cd {directory name}" then press tab to autofill the random characters that are necessary)
- if a cpp file is not in the directory you're in, you need to do relative addressing (look it up)
- if no -o name is specified, the output name will be a.out
# how to run:
.\{name of output file}.exe
